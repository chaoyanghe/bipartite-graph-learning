# Adversarial Learning with Graph Convolutional Networks for Unsupervised Bipartite Graph Embedding


## HGCN
1. run HGCN model on the tencent dataset.
~~~
sh run_hgcn.sh tencent
~~~
It may take XX minutes to get the result.

2. run HGCN model on the cora dataset:
~~~
sh run_hgcn.sh cora
~~~
It may take XX minutes to get the result.

3. run HGCN model on the citeseer dataset:
~~~
sh run_hgcn.sh citeseer
~~~
